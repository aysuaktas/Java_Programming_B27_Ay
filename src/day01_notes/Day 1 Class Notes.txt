____________________________________________________________

cpu: central processing unit
	what is given instruction to the computer

Memory

	ram
		8GB
		program

	hard dive
		cd, usb

	byte: memory unit
		1 GB of ram ~ 1 billion bytes
		500 GB of hard dive ~ 500 billion bytes

	1 byte is made of 8 bits(binary digit)

Binary 

	language that computer understand
	0s and 1s

	00000000 -> 0
	00000001 -> 1
	00000010 -> 2
	00000011 -> 3
	00000100 -> 4
	00000101 -> 5
	00000110 -> 6
	00000000 -> 0
	10000000 -> 128
	11111111 -> 255 (8 ones)
	100000000 -> 256 (9th digit is 1, the rest 0s)

ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange
	
	every character has a number related to it

	character outside of English also have numbers: unicode
		emojis

Algorithm: step by step solution to problem

pseudocode: not code, in English. steps to solve the problem. What the code should do

How does the computer understand our actions?

	We write high level code, using a programming language (human understandable)

	Translate the code: compile or interpret
		different languages are compiled, or interpreted, or both
			compile: translate whole file
			interpret: running some parts and translating 

	translated version is low level (machine language)

The order of the code is important

Java can be used for many different functions, but our main goal is to learn how to write java code, understand it, so that we can automate testing

Where do programmers write code?

	any text editor

		ex: sublime

	IDE: integrated development environment

		helpful tool to help use write code

			IntelliJ is an IDE

File: stores information

Extensions:
	.doc
	.pdf
	.exe
	.png
	.txt
	.java

Syntax: grammar rules for code

	symbols
		{} curly brackets
		[] square brackets
		() parenthesis
		; semi colon

What is the difference between JDK, JRE, JVM

	JDK: java developer kit
		allows us to write java code
		contains the JRE and JVM, the compiler

	JRE: java runtime environment
		contains JVM
		needed java files(libraries)

	JVM: java virtual machine
		runs the java code
		interpret bytecode
