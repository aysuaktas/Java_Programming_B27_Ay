	What are variables?
	How to declare variables?
	How to assign to variables?
	How to declare and assign variables?
	How to reassign?
	How to concatenate variables with characters?
	What are primitive datatypes?
	What are the default types?


Variables:
	container that holds information

	datatype name = value

Datatype:

	primitive datatypes

		Integer Numbers: (non fractional number) ex: 5

			byte
			short
			int      <- default type in compiler
			long

		Floating Numbers: (fractional numbers with a float point ) ex: 4.99

			float
			double   <- default type in compiler

		Boolean Type(true or false)

			boolean

	When you type a whole number in the code, it is automatically treated as an int type
	When you type a floating number in the code, it is automatically treated as a double type

	To tell the compiler we want to define a float value we use f/F after the number
	To tell the compiler we want to define a long value we use l/L after the number

		Character type:
			char: holds a single character

				a char value is given with a single quote

				Ex: char first = 'a';

			unicode: every character has numbers related to it       // todo

				ASCII: portion of the unicode

	non primitive types

		String: 
			not a primitive datatype, object type

			value is multiple character, sequence of characters. Use double quotations  (( "" ))

	Q: What is the difference between 'A' and "A"?
			the single quote 'A' is a char type
			the double quote "A" is a String type

			difference is the type in the code. If we printed both, they would look the same
			non-primitive types take more memory

Note: If you want to make numbers more readable in the code, you can use underscore. The underscore does not affect the number in any way.

	Ex: 1000 -> not too readable
		1_000 -> readable

		1000000 -> not too readable
		1_000_000 -> readable

Concatenation:

	+ used with Strings

	combine anything with the String and the result of the concatenation is String

Code Execution:
	top to bottom
	left to right

Todo
	make sure you have github access
	create a replit account and join the team
	practice
