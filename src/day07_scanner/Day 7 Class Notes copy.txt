Recap

Unary Operators

        +       (plus) positive number
        -       (minus) negative number
        ++      incrementing, adding 1
        --      decrementing, subtracting 1

        pre: operator comes becomes the variable
            ++num
        post: operator comes after the variable 
            num++

Relational Operators
    the result is boolean value (true or false)

    > greater than
    >= greater than or equal to
    < less than
    <= less than or equal to
    == equals
    != not equals

Logical Operators
    
    && and
    || or
    ! not

    short circuit: 2 operators. More efficient in execution. When the code runs left to right, if the result of the boolean is known it doesn't need to continue executing

        && || vs & |

        double && ||

            program will not keep running when the result is known

        single & |

            program will run all of the code left to right always, no matter if the result of the boolean is already determined

Operator Precedence
    Execution happens from top to bottom. Left to right

        ! - (negative) ++ --
        * / %
        + - 
        < > <= >=
        == !=
        &&
        ||
        = += -= *= /= %=

Scanner

    Scanner is a CLASS that has METHODs that allow us to type values in the console

    class are java file

    methods are blocks of code that are ready to use

    Why are we using Scanner?   
        avoid hard coded. Get the idea of how to use information that comes from outside of the side

    How do we use Scanner?

        1) import the class

            import: allows us to use a file that is in a different package

            - order of a java file: 
                package -> imports -> class
                    PIC

            Scanner is in java.util

            syntax: 

                import packageName.className;
                import java.util.Scanner;

        2) create a Scanner object

            Scanner name = new Scanner(System.in);

            common names for the object: scan, scanner, input, keyboard, in

        3) use/run methods from the object

            syntax to call method:
                object.method()

                nextByte()
                nextShort()
                nextInt()   *
                nextLong()
                nextFloat() 
                nextDouble() *
                nextBoolean()
                next()
                nextLine() *
