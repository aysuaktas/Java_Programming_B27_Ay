Day 8 Scanner

day08_scanner
____________________________________________________________

Scanner class
____________________________________________________________

Office hours: extra session on Wednesdays optional 

Hard coding: information/value is directly in the code
Dynamic: it changes when needed, come from outside the code

Scanner: has methods that allow us to type in the console. The information typed can be used in the code

	method: some code that someone wrote and we can use

		nextByte()
		nextShort()
		nextInt()
		nextLong()
		nextFloat()
		nextDouble()
		nextBoolean()

		next(): get a String from the console, but only one word
		nextLine(): get a String from the console, but can be multiple words. Accepts the enter input

		Problem: using nextLine() after any other Scanner method causes the enter input to not store out data properly, so we need to add an extra nextLine() between the two parts

		-> if you only have nextLine() methods there is no problem

Using Scanner
	
	- import: to use a file outside of the package we have to import the class
			import java.util.Scanner;

	- create Scanner object: 
		Scanner name = new Scanner(System.in);

	- use the Scanner methods
		object.method()
