Day 10 If statements

day10_if_statements
____________________________________________________________

multi branch if statements
if without brackets

practice
	java
	problem solving
		try to write algorithms
		redo class tasks -> understand why we wrote some specific code
		try some code, run and see what is does, put comments

Conditional Statements: controlling the flow of the program

	single if

		if(boolean){
			// statements that get executed when the boolean is TRUE
		}

		boolean is true: code in if block runs
		boolean is false: nothing, code resume after the if statement

	if else

		if(boolean){
			// statements that get executed when the boolean is TRUE
		} else {
			// statements that get executed when the boolean is FALSE
		}

		boolean is true: code in if block runs
		boolean is false: code in else block runs	

	multi branch
		whenever there is multiple conditions that are related we can use the multi branch if to handle them

		execution for multi branch: the first condition is checked, if it true the first block is executed, otherwise(false) it will check the next condition.

		if(boolean 1){
			// statements that get executed when the boolean 1 is TRUE
		} else if(boolean 2) {
			// statements that get executed when the boolean 2 is TRUE
		} else if(boolean 3){
			// statements that get executed when the boolean 3 is TRUE
		} else {
			// statements that get executed when all the other boolean conditions were FALSE
		}

	Note: you can declare as many else if blocks are needed
	Note: you can add else at the end, it is optional
	Note: once a condition is true and its code block is executed the other conditions are NOT checked
	Note: multi branch statements are used to make the code more efficient, more readable

if without brackets
	
	if statements can be created without brackets, but we will not be able to write multiple statements

	If without brackets will execute only the next line after it

	Take away: always use brackets

____________________________________________________________

Ternary

	different way to write an if statement

	returnValue = boolean_expression ? trueValue : falseValue;	

		? if
		: else
