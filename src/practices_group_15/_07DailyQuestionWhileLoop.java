        //Explanation:
        /*  This is an infinite loop. It will always print:

        I like java
        good to hear that

        again and again. Because; it says that while i<=10, print the statements inside of the loop. After 'I like java' is printed, it does ++i, so i becomes 11. Then, after 'good to hear that' is printed, we do i--; so, i becomes 10 in the next line. So, we start again, and the process is the same. It will continue until the condition in while loop is false. But it will always be true. So, this is an infinite loop.
