    // Software testing which is done without planning and Documentation is known as?

    The answer is ADHOC TESTING.

    - Adhoc testing is a testing which does not require planning, documentation, or a process to be followed (so, it saves a lot of time). Because, the aim is the finding defects with a random checking approach.

    - Adhoc testing can be performed when there is a limited time to elaborative (detailed) testing. It is usually performed after the formal test execution.

    - Adhoc testing can be effective only if the tester is knowledgeable of the system under test.

    - There are 3 types of Adhoc testing:

        1) Buddy testing -> Two people (in general, a developer and a tester) mutually work on to identify defects in the same module. The QA performs the necessary checks, and the developer tries to fix all the defects in the early stages.

        2) Pair testing -> Two testers (experienced and non-experienced) only who have different knowledge levels work on to find defects through sharing ideas. These two QA engineers check one module and help each other simultaneously. For ex: One QA looks for the defects through execute the tests, and the other QA documents the findings.

        3) Monkey testing -> Randomly testing the product without test cases in order to break the system. In Monkey testing, QA engineer works alone to find all the bugs/inconsistencies with planned behaviour.
