    // What is the difference between:  add(index,Object) and set(index,Object) methods?


    /*
    add(index,Object) and set(index,Object) methods are both ArrayList methods.

    add(index,Object/element) method adds the element at the given index number. After we add this index number, values starting from that index number moves to the right. The value in that index number does not disappear, just moves.

    set(index,Object) method replaces the element at the given index number, with the new element. So, previous element a kind of disappears.

    So, basically, we can say that add(index,Object) method is used to add a new element, however set(index,Object) method replaces/updates the given element.
