    /*
    Class is a set of instructions for building an Object. It allows us to define variables and methods.

    Class is a template. Object is the instance, physical copy of a class.

    Object is the instance of a class. It can store data. It is possible to create multiple objects from one class. If "Car" is a class, BMW and Mercedes can be the objects.
