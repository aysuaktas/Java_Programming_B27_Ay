    1- What is encapsulation? How do you encapsulate a data in java?

            Encapsulation is data hiding in java. In order to encapsulate, we define the data private and in order to initialize the data in another class, we create a setter() method and in order to get the date in another class, we use getter() method.


     2- Can you encapsulate a method in java?

            We can encapsulate a method in java if it is a return type method.


    3- What is read-only data? Can you give an example to this?

            If only getter() method is created for the data, it is called read-only method.

            As a usage; the data will be initialized only once in its own class or initialized by constructor and won't be changed anymore like a username in a website or a registration email address.

     4- What is write-only data? Can you give an example to this?
            If only setter() method is created for the data, it is called write-only data.

            As a usage; a write-only property could be used to set a password on a User object. Since passwords are usually stored in hashed form, there is (and should be) no way to retrieve a password after it has been set.
