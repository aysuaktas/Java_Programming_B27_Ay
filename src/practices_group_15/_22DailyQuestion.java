1- What is inheritance?

	Inheritance is one of the OOP (object-oriented programming) principles that is used for creating “is a” relationship among the classes to pass information from one class to another one. It means that inheritance allows a class (child / derived / sub class) to inherit the variables and methods of another class (parent / base / super class), and it gives us the code re-usability. For inheritance in Java, we need to use “extends” keyword, and its syntax is: ChildClass extends ParentClass

2- What can be inherited from a parent class?

	All the accessible variables and methods (depending on their access modifiers):
		- if variables and methods are:
			- public —> inherited
			- protected —> inherited
			- default —> only if they are in the same package —> inherited
			- private—> not inherited!
	Constructors are not inherited, but the sub class must call a constructor of super class.

3- What are super(), this(), super, this?

	this      —> reference to the current class object
	this()   —> calling a constructor in the current class

	super    —> reference to the super class object
	super() —> calling a constructor that is made in the super class. If the super class has default constructor, compiler puts super( ) automatically.
