    /*
    What do following git commands do? -> add, checkout, branch, push?

        add:  git add is tracking all files at one time using, and staging everything. However, it is better to use “git add filename” to start tracking and staging a file.

        checkout:  if we want to checkout to a branch which means if we want to work in another branch from we are working on, we write the branch name that we want to work on after we write “git checkout” -> “git checkout branchName”.

        branch:  “git branch“ shows us all the branches, and the branch that we are working on right now will be in green color. If we write a branch name after we write git branch as “git branch branchName“, it creates a new branch.

        push : “git push” command shares the changes from our local repository to the remote repository (GitHub)


        ----> David's explanation:

            add:  this command adds a file to the staging area

            checkout:  this command is used to switch from one branch to another

            branch:  this command lists all the local branches in the current repository

            push:  this command sends the committed changes of selected branch (from your local repository) to a remote repository
