    What are the different levels of testing?

    In dynamic testing, there are 4 different testing levels.

         1) The first level of testing is “Unit (module / component) testing” —> Developers write code for a small unit at a time, and each unit needs to be tested by developers in dev environment.

         2) The second level of testing is “Integration testing” —>  (Mostly) Developers test multiple related units to confirm several parts of the application work after integration, in dev environment.

        3) The third level of testing is “System testing” —>  Software itself is tested in QA environment. —>  SDETs test Functionality & Performance Testers test Non-Functionality.

        4) The fourth level of testing is “UAT (User Acceptance Testing)” —> Software itself is tested in Staging environment to evaluate whether software is ready to release or not. —>  It divides into 2 testing types;
                a) UAT – Alpha —>  UAT team (testers, mostly QAs) tests it in staging environment
                b) UAT – Beta —>  client & end-users test it in staging environment —>  After UAT testing, the app will be released.
